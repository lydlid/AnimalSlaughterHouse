# Animal Slaughter House

## brief introduction

- This is a small game that we have implemented based on libgdx.
- The basic idea is a multiplayer online battle royale mode game.
- Basic settings
    - Each player has an initial 100 blood.
    - The default birth point for each player is the bottom left corner of the entire map.
    - Each map has a few drop points where you can pick up a specific weapon. After that , you can use your current weapon to attack other players on the server.
    - The winning condition is to kill all players on the server and the winner is the one who survives to the end.
